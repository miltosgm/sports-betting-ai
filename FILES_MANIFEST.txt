1. LOAD MODEL:
   python3 -c "import pickle; m=pickle.load(open('models/ensemble_model_v2.pkl','rb'))"

2. MAKE PREDICTIONS:
   - Requires 30 features
   - Scale with: m['scaler']
   - Predict with: m['models']['lightgbm']

3. BACKTEST VALIDATION:

4. FOR PRODUCTION:
   See DEPLOYMENT_V2.md for full integration guide

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE:
  [ ] Review PHASE_1-3_IMPROVEMENT_REPORT.md
  [ ] Test ensemble predictions with sample data
  [ ] Set up API connection to odds providers
  [ ] Configure logging and monitoring

SHORT-TERM (1-4 WEEKS):
  [ ] Deploy to paper trading environment
  [ ] Track predictions vs actual results
  [ ] Validate 54%+ win rate in real conditions
  [ ] Monitor for concept drift

MEDIUM-TERM (1-3 MONTHS):
  [ ] Integrate real injury database API
  [ ] Add actual weather data
  [ ] Connect to referee historical data
  [ ] Begin small live betting ($50-100 per game)

LONG-TERM (3+ MONTHS):
  [ ] Scale betting size based on performance
  [ ] Expand to other sports/leagues
  [ ] Implement advanced risk management
  [ ] Continuous model monitoring and retraining

================================================================================
RISK DISCLAIMERS
================================================================================

⚠️  BACKTESTING ≠ LIVE TRADING
    - Historical data may have look-ahead bias
    - Real market conditions differ from simulation
    - Past performance does not guarantee future results

⚠️  VARIANCE IS NORMAL
    - 10-20 game losing streaks are possible
    - Requires strong bankroll management
    - Don't expect consistent daily profits

⚠️  SPORTSBOOK LIMITATIONS
    - Winning accounts may be limited or closed
    - Odds may be unavailable at prediction time
    - Late line movement common

⚠️  TECHNICAL RISKS
    - Models trained on limited data (763 games)
    - Edge may diminish over time
    - Requires continuous monitoring
